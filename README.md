# merge_img

A twitter bot that generates a collage when tagged under a tweet with more than one picture

## How it works

- Mention the twitter handle (@merge_img) under a tweet with more than 1 picture in it

![mention twitter handle](./images/examples/collage-1.png?raw=true)

- The bot replies with your collage shortly after
